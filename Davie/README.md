##*DAVIE* Project
An Embarassingly Parallel Linux Cluster

The cluster is growing by node, currently being 2 nodes of AMD64 processors, without an apriori specific node number goal in the plan.

###Hardware List:

  - 2, AMD64 series FX8350, 4.0 GHz clocked (with CPU fans included)
  - 2, Gigabyte 78LMT-USB3 (FX-AM2+ socketed) motherboards
  - 4, 8GB dynamic SIMM (16GB ram per node)
  - 2, 250GB SSD SATA drives
  - 1, 2TB WD Hard drive
  (DVD RW drive, usb external portable drive)
  (USB Keyboard and mouse as needed for set-up configuration only)
  (monitor added as needed 

###Operating System and Tools

  -  Debian 8.4.0 AMD64 Linux (Jessie)
  -  OpenMPI

###Software and Language Support
These are installed on each node, but clearly application programming is typically centralized, mainly on the master node.

  -  GCC Gnu compiler collection
     (C/C++, Gfortran95 compilers)
  -  Gnu R Statistical Programming Environment
  -  Python 3 programming (Spyder IDE) environment
